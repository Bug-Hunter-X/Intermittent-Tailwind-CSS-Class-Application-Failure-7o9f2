# Intermittent Tailwind CSS Class Application Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not consistently applied across components. The issue is intermittent and hard to reproduce reliably.  The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code, and `bugSolution.js` shows a potential fix.

## Description

In certain situations, Tailwind CSS classes fail to render correctly, leading to unexpected visual inconsistencies. The problem appears random and doesn't follow a clear pattern, making it difficult to debug.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully checking for potential conflicts with other CSS or JavaScript libraries, ensuring that Tailwind CSS is correctly configured and that the build process is clean.
